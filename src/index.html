                        The current ballot system does not offer <span>transparency</span> in counting of votes. There are several threats of voting frauds,
                        like fake voters, frauds in the polling booths etc. So the need for a <span>decentralized</span> fraud-less system has arisen.

                        In an era of increasing digital spread we can't rely on old methods, we need innovation but most importantly we need secure innovation.
                        Blockchain suits well this task due to its tamperproof nature.

                        The following article outlines the potential of the blockchain technology to establish a

                    <p>
                        Before diving in this section the reader should know what a <span>smart contract</span> is. In short, a smart contract is a computer
                        protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the
                        performance of credible transactions without <span>third parties</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 25px">
                        This blockchain system uses the <span>Proof of Authority</span> consensus algorithm: transactions and blocks are validated by approved
                        accounts, known as validators. The process is automated and does not require validators to be constantly monitoring their computers. It,
                        however, does require maintaining the computer (the authority node) uncompromised. With PoA, individuals earn the right to become
                        validators, so there is an incentive to retain the position that they have gained. By attaching a reputation to identity, validators are
                        incentivized to uphold the transaction process, as they do not wish to have their identities attached to a negative reputation.
                    </p>
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 40px">Election as a smart contract</h3>
                    <p>
                        In our election system we have defined an election as a smart contract. So in our network the election is the agreement between the
                        participating nodes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this simple definition an election vote is irreversibly secured in the blockchain, the next step is to actually define the nodes'
                        roles in the blockchain
                    </p>
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 40px">Roles</h3>
                    <p>Every partecipant must have a role:</p>
                    <h4>Administrator</h4>
                    <p>
                        The administrators will manage all the execution of the election. They can create, start, close and display the results of the election.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Voters</h4>
                    <p>
                        A voter is a basic participant who casts a vote in the election. Voter can verify their eligibility & authenticate themselves and load
                        election ballots.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Constituency nodes</h4>
                    <p>
                        These nodes verify the voters by means of accessing smart contracts. If the voter is verified by all the constituency nodes then the
                        voter’s vote will be considered and appended into the blockchain.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Boot nodes</h4>
                    <p>A boot node will help the constituency nodes reach each other and communicate with each other.</p>
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 40px">Election process</h3>
                    <div class="wrapper">
                        <p>
                            The election process is carried out by the smart contracts, once the election ballots get created by the administrators voters
                            authenitcate to the blockchain via a defined way of doing so - that can be via <span>CIE (Italy)</span> or other secure ID systems.
                            The voter's verification is held again by the administrators. Once a voter successfully registers itself it gains a
                            <span>unique ID alongside with a security code</span> that must be used to cast a vote.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When a voter votes and consensus is reached the voter loses the ability to vote (a property linked to the voter on the system gets
                            changed) in order to avoid duplicate votes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once the election finishes every participant in the blockchain should update their ledger copy for ease in counting of the votes.
                            The smart contracts publish the final count after the election is over & thereby it’s displayed by the administrators. This way
                            there
                            <span>cannot</span> be frauds due to the fact that every node counts the votes.

                    <p>
                        This kind of architecture results secure and efficient but errors and bugs can occur. Human error should always be considered. On an IT
                        level though the architecture is not vulnerable to
                        <span>DDoS attacks</span> (the main flaw of blockchain systems) due to the Proof of Authority algorithm (if such attack occurs an
                        individual would be easily caught.)
                    </p>
                    <p>The main concern should be to keep validators nodes uncompromised.</p>

                                    This E-voting provides proof to voter and provides transparency to the voter. In traditional voting system there was no
                                    guarantee that whether the vote casted by the voter is counted correctly. But in this voting system a voter can verify
                                    whether his vote was counted correctly to the right candidate.

                                    In the traditional voting system malpractices can be performed on the polling booth. Coerced voting can be carried out. But
                                    in this voting system voters can cast their vote with <span>total privacy</span> and it can be done in any location.

                    <p>
                        Blockchain seems to be the next big step torwards a secure, transparent, decentralized, privacy-friendly and cost efficient e-voting
                        system.
